Prefixed with [Not on Youtube] if that is the case. option in settings, under "Advanced", to do this for ALL recent episodes. Turning on this option may increase the length of time taken to show episode listings for some shows.

- Remove code to check for version 3.2 of the Youtube plugin

- The text [Not on Youtube] will appear beside the first (usually the latest) episode in the show list, if that video cannot be found on Youtube. For some shows that will mean that the show is not Youtube (e.g. US shows), for others it means that the latest episode is not yet on Youtube (sometimes it takes a day or two for new episodes).

- Added socket timeout handling

- Improved cache handling - if an error occur. You can now set the socket timeout in the plugin settingss processing data from the cache, a fresh copy of the same data is taken from the web and that is processed instead

- Added more debug logging


The 4od plugin uses the Youtube plugin to play recent 4od programmes from Youtube. If you don't have the Youtube plugin installed the Youtube plugin should automatically install when the 4od plugin first tries to use it.
However the current version of the Youtube plugin (3.2.0) doesn't work with the 4od videos. The changes described in the following issues must be made to fix those problems:

	https://code.google.com/p/youtubexbmc/issues/detail?id=46
	https://code.google.com/p/youtubexbmc/issues/detail?id=47

A version of the Youtube plugin that has these fixes can be found here: http://mossy-xbmc-repo.googlecode.com/files/plugin.video.youtube-3.2.1.zip. Hopefully the next version released by the Youtube plugin guys will incorporate the changes.

If you don't have the Youtube plugin already installed then it's best if you install the version from the officail XBMC repository first. Then if you install my version it will be replaced by the "official" version when they make their next release.

Note that you need to be logged into Youtube, via the Youtube plugin, in order for it to work. Playback should work, download may not.


Older programmes (before mid-August 2012) should play and download as before.

- Added HTTP cache disable option in settings

- (John Taylor) Added gzip handling. Occassionally web pages are downloaded compressed. This fix handles those occassions.

- Improved error handling

- Bug fix: Latest/Most Popular/A-Z/etc. Thumbnails coming up blank

- Bug fix: Prevent caching of 0-byte pages or 404 error pages.

- Bug fix: Orphaned processes in Linux, one for each downloaded episode, causing delays in shutting down XBMC.

Version 1.0.2 (30 May 2012)

(njtaylor) Fixed episodes not playing via "ll" server ("Script Error")

(alnicol) Fixed error preventing download action

(spoyser) Allow spaces in download path

Set cache folder to the originally intended folder: [XBMC]/userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.4od/cache

Problem: Changes in the episode listing webpage caused the plug-in to stall indefinitely
Fix 1: Update the plug-in to match the webpage changes
Fix 2: Change the way the listings are parsed so that future changes won't cause the plug-in to hang, even if the episodes won't play, or show in the listing.

Dynamically determine the URL of the 4od swf player from the webpage, resolving any URL redirect in the process. This should resolve the "plays for 1 or 2 minutes and then stops" problem.
